## ✨ Available Pipelines

### 1. **Google Analytics Pipeline**
End-to-end serverless pipeline that ingests Google Analytics event/campaign data and processes it for analytics and BI.

- **Ingestion**: Lambda function or Glue Python Shell pulls data from GA API into S3 (landing zone)
- **Schema discovery**: Glue Crawler registers table in Glue Catalog
- **Transformation**: Glue Spark jobs cleanse and partition raw data, write to raw/clean zones
- **Metadata management**: Glue Catalog tables for landing and raw data
- **Analytics & reporting**:  
  - Redshift Spectrum for ad hoc queries on raw S3 data  
  - Internal Redshift tables for BI/reporting/dashboarding
- **Orchestration**: AWS Step Functions
- **Data Quality**: Example of Glue Data Quality rules

*See* `google-analytics-pipeline/README.md` *for full details.*

## 🏗️ How to Use

Each pipeline is organized as a **modular folder** with its own documentation and code.  
To deploy a pipeline, follow the `README.md` in its directory.

**Example: Deploying the Google Analytics Pipeline**
1. `cd google-analytics-pipeline/terraform`
2. `terraform init && terraform apply`  
   _(provisions S3, Glue DBs, Crawlers, etc.)_
3. Deploy Lambda and Glue Jobs as per `lambda/` and `glue_jobs/`
4. Create or update Step Function with workflow JSON from `step_function/`
5. Run jobs or trigger Step Function to start the pipeline

## 📚 Best Practices Demonstrated

- Serverless & event-driven data ingestion (Lambda, Step Functions)
- Scalable storage and schema evolution using S3 and Glue Catalog
- Orchestration of ETL steps using Step Functions
- Ad hoc and scheduled queries using Athena & Redshift Spectrum
- Data quality enforcement using AWS Glue DQ and/or PyDeequ
- Modular and reproducible infra with Terraform
